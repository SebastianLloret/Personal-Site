			<p>I'm an Applied Mathematics major / Computer Science minor at CU Boulder. Social Media Director @ Keep Colorado Green, previously Intern @ elope, Inc.</p>
			<p>Language, photography, and technology are my passions. I speak Spanish natively, French fluently, and I have a basic grasp of German. Aesthetic photos are my vibe, and machine learning is interesting.</p>
			<p>I believe that climate change is one of the most pressing global obstacles before us. You'll probably see me at climate marches or around campus with KCG.</p>
			<p>Reach out to me on my Twitter, Facebook, e-mail, or via phone<p>
