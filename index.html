	        <hr>
	        <p>I'm a polyglot studying Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at
	          the University of Colorado Boulder. Currently I'm an IT intern in the
	          APPM department, and also the Social Media Director for Keep Colorado
	          Green.</p>
					<p>Here's a link to my résumé, portfolio, and recent projects if that's what
						you're looking for.</p>

	    <h2>Interests</h2>
	      <p>I love travel, and anything that involves foreign cultures instantly
	      piques my curiosity. My main spheres of interest lie in linguistics,
	      photography, and the environment.</p>

	      <h3>Language</h3>
	        <p>I'm a hobbyist linguist with native fluency in English and Spanish,
	          conversational fluency in French, and a basic grasp of German. I think
	          languages are a beautiful window into different cultures, and one of the
	          easiest ways to broaden one's own perspective.</p>

	      <h3>Photography</h3>
	        <p>If I'm not locked indoors, chances are you'll catch me taking advantage
	           of Boulder's beautiful scenery and night life. I use a Nikon D7100, and
	            keep all of my work on my portfolio.</p>

	      <h3>Environment</h3>
	        <p>I believe that climate change is one of the most pressing global
	          obstacles before us, alongside resource distribution issues developing
	          nations face. You'll probably see me at climate marches in the Boulder
	          area, or at Keep Colorado Green events.</p>
